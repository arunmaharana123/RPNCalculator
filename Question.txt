Exercise: Basic Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator
 
The RPN notation is also known as postfix expression. The capabilities of the Calculator are as follows:
1. Supports operations for sum, difference, division, multiplication.
2. Supports floating point operations.
3. Use '^' for exponent operator. values entered as "X Y ^" are calculated as X to the power of Y.
4. Use '%' for the percent operation. values entered as "X %" are calculated as X/100.
5. Use ‘!’ for Factorial (unary operation).
